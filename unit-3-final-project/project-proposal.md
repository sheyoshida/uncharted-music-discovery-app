# Access Code 2.2 Final Project Proposal

**Project Name: Face The Music**  
**Team Members: Zoufishan Mehdi, Artur Lan, Shena Yoshida, Henna Ahmed**  

## The Problem 

It is challenging and time-consuming to discover regional and emerging art as the media widely supports a homogenous cultural experience (ie: syndicated top 40 radio is played everywhere). This uniform experience reduces cultural awareness, curiosity and diversity. 

## The Solution 

Create a convenient, high quality experience to discover and explore regional artists based on user's location.
