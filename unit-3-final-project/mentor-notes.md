### Mentor Notes

## first meeting: Saturday, November 14th

We met with Jiaqi at C4Q and showed her our wireframes and explained the project. 

These are her suggestions: 
- to make app load faster cache the last 5 api searches
- save last api serach in NSUserDefaults so that it can be used when offline
- show app ui to other people and get feedback
- for onboarding - notifications + nsuserdefaults + detect device (for force touch)
- for bio inconsistencies, run word count and loop through json then use the longest one
- for the presentation she suggested reveal.js for slides that can be committed to github

We're meeting with her again on Saturday November 21 at C4Q.
