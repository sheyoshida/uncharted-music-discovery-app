### Mentor Notes

## first meeting: Saturday, November 14th

We met with Jiaqi at C4Q and showed her our wireframes and explained the project. 

These are her suggestions: 
- to make app load faster cache the last 5 api searches
- save last api serach in NSUserDefaults so that it can be used when offline
- show app ui to other people and get feedback
- for onboarding - notifications + nsuserdefaults + detect device (for force touch)
- for bio inconsistencies, run word count and loop through json then use the longest one
- for the presentation she suggested reveal.js for slides that can be committed to github

We're meeting with her again on Saturday November 21 at C4Q.

## second meeting: Saturday, November 22nd

Questions for meeting: 
- review wireframes			
- how will we measure success			
- how will we retain users			
- ask about playlist feature and how to implement Spotify oauth			
- how to deal with multiple api calls - prevent demo day crash			

Mentor suggestions: 
- make sure map feature matters (search bar, visualization, changing data)
- everything included should solve a problem
- consider who target customers are, come up with user stories for them
- for user retention, consider newsfeed for concerts in location or notifications, geofencing
- measure success by counting api calls, we could also research google analytics for apps
- find out how often user will need to log into spotify (maybe add that to the start/end destination)
- add twitter sharing function on "my songs" screen as way to engage new users and add a social element

Next mentor meeting scheduled for Tuesday, December 1st after our third demo.
